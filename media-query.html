            <h2>Ether 12:27</h2>
            <p>And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be
                humble, and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for, if they humble
                themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</p>

            <h2>Helaman 5:12</h2>
            <p>And now my sons, remember, remember, that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer that ye must build your
                foundation, that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind,
                yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you, to
                drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which
                is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.</p>
