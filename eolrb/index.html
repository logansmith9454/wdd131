                    <h2>Roux Method</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Roux method is a 3x3 speedsolving method that has become
                        increasingly popular in recent years. It is very efficient, uses
                        less algorithms than other competition-viable methods, and
                        utilizes turns in the middle layer in a way that is very visually
                        distinct.

                    <h2>LSE</h2>
                    <p>
                        LSE stands for Last Six Edges, which is the last part of a Roux
                        solve. There are several steps that it is traditionally broken
                        down into, which are EO, LR, and L4E. As a speedcuber learns more
                        advanced LSE, they can begin implementing more complicated
                        techniques that help make transitions between steps smoother and
                        take fewer moves to execute, or even solve multiple of these steps
                        at the same time.

                    <h2>EO</h2>
                    <p>
                        EO, or edge orientation, does not solve any pieces, but instead it
                        simplifies the case to something that is much easier to see and
                        control. Each edge piece has one “sticker” that matches either the
                        top or bottom side (in this case, either white or yellow). In EO,
                        all the edges are flipped such that the matching sticker is on
                        either the top or the bottom face. When this step is complete, the
                        top side will all be white and yellow, and the bottom side will
                        all be white and yellow. No white or yellow stickers will be on
                        any other face. There are 9 different cases, depending on how many
                        edges are flipped on the top and on the bottom. These can be
                        learned easily and quickly and take very few moves. There are also
                        several ways to solve each case, so it is easy to do them from
                        multiple angles and cancel moves to make the next step easier.

                    <h2>LR</h2>
                    <p>
                        After EO is complete, the next step is to solve the left and right
                        faces. Both the left and the right faces are typically missing one
                        piece at this point in the solve. The missing pieces are called
                        the LR edges (because they belong to the Left and Right faces,
                        while all the other unsolved pieces belong in the middle). A
                        beginner would insert the two LR edges into the bottom of the cube
                        and put them into the top together to solve everything except the
                        middle layer of the cube. In more advanced steps, this process is
                        simplified or completely merged with EO.

                    <p>
                        L4E stands for Last 4 Edges. At this point in the solve the
                        remaining 4 edges can easily be solved with a few simple patterns,
                        resulting in a solved cube. We won’t get into the details here, as
                        this page focuses on the EO and LR steps, specifically combining
                        the two.

                    <h2>EOLR</h2>
                    <p>
                        EOLR is the process of performing EO while simultaneously
                        inserting the LR edges into the bottom layer of the cube so that
                        they can be inserted easily and without pausing. It is done by
                        executing a specific EO case that will make it possible to end
                        with the LR edges on the bottom. Sometimes these cases take more
                        moves than the regular EO, but it saves moves by eliminating half
                        of the LR step. This is a moderately complicated step and should
                        only be learned after being competent at EO.

                    <h2>EOLRb</h2>
                    <p>
                        EOLRb is similar to EOLR, but instead of inserting the LR edges
                        into the bottom of the cube, a specific EOLR case is used to solve
                        the LR edges directly. Again, this step is less efficient than
                        EOLR, and much less efficient than EO, but it skips the LR step
                        entirely, so it requires less moves overall and can be executed
                        faster. This is a very advanced step to use, and very few people
                        in the world know every case and use them effectively. It is
                        complicated to use and should only be learned after one is
                        competent with EOLR.
