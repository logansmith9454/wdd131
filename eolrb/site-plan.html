        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this website is to help speedcubers (those who solve Rubik's cubes quickly) to find better
            solutions to one step of the solve. This step, EOLRb, is somewhat advanced, but an optimal solution can
            easily be computed.</p>

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>The target audience is those who use the Roux method for speedsolving, and are very fast with it (<12
                seconds).</p>
                <!-- change this -->

                <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
                <p>I will use Javascript to calculate the optimal solution(s) for any cases that the user enters and
                    display them. It will ask the user to pick their favorite and store it permanently. If they ask for
                    a case they've already requested, it will give them their chosen solution.</p>

                <h4>Roux Method</h4>
                <p>
                    The Roux method is a 3x3 speedsolving method that has become increasingly popular in recent years.
                    It is very
                    efficient, uses less algorithms than other methods, and utilizes turns in the middle layer in a way
                    that is very
                    visually distinct.
                </p>

                <h4>LSE</h4>
                <p>
                    LSE stands for Last Six Edges, which is the last part of a Roux solve. There are several steps that
                    it is
                    traditionally broken down into, which are EO, LR, and L4E. As a speedcuber learns more advanced
                    techniques, they
                    can begin implementing more complicated techniques that help make transitions between steps smoother
                    and take
                    fewer moves to execute or even solve multiple of these steps at the same time.
                </p>

                <h4>EO</h4>
                <p>
                    EO, or edge orientation, does not solve any pieces, but instead it simplifies the case to something
                    that is much
                    easier to see and control. Each edge has one “sticker” that matches either the top or bottom side
                    (in this case,
                    either white or yellow). In EO, all the edges are flipped such that the matching sticker is on
                    either the top or
                    the bottom face. When this step is complete, the top side will all be white and yellow, and the
                    bottom side will
                    all be white and yellow. No white or yellow stickers will be on any other face. There are 9
                    different cases,
                    depending on how many edges are flipped on the top and on the bottom. These can be learned easily
                    and quickly and
                    take very few moves. There are also several ways to solve each case, so it is easy to do them from
                    multiple angles
                    and cancel moves to make the next step easier.
                </p>

                <h4>LR</h4>
                <p>
                    After EO is complete, the left and right faces are finished. Both the left and the right faces are
                    typically
                    missing one piece at this point in the solve. The missing pieces are called the LR edges (because
                    they belong to
                    the Left and Right faces, while all the other unsolved edges belong in the middle). A beginner would
                    insert the
                    two LR edges into the bottom of the cube and put them into the top together to solve everything
                    except the middle
                    layer of the cube. In more advanced steps, this process is simplified or completely merged with EO.
                </p>

                <h4>L4E</h4>
                <p>
                    L4E stands for Last 4 Edges. At this point in the solve the remaining 4 edges can easily be solved
                    with a few
                    simple patterns, resulting in a solved cube. We won’t get into the details here, as this page
                    focuses on the EO
                    and LR steps, specifically combining the two.
                </p>

                <h4>EOLR</h4>
                <p>
                    EOLR is the process of performing EO while simultaneously inserting the LR edges into the bottom
                    layer of the cube
                    so that they can be inserted easily and without pausing. It is done by executing a specific EO case
                    that will make
                    it possible to end with the LR edges on the bottom. Sometimes these cases take more moves than the
                    regular EO, but
                    it saves moves by eliminating half of the LR step. This is a moderately complicated step and should
                    only be
                    learned after one is competent at EO.
                </p>

                <h4>EOLRb</h4>
                <p>
                    EOLRb is similar to EOLR, but instead of inserting the LR edges into the bottom of the cube, a
                    specific EOLR case
                    is used to solve the LR edges directly. Again, this step is less efficient than EOLR, and much less
                    efficient than
                    EO, but it skips the LR step entirely, so it requires less moves overall and can be executed faster.
                    This is a
                    very advanced step to use, and very few people in the world know every case and use them
                    effectively. It is very
                    complicated to use and should only be learned after one is competent with EOLR.
